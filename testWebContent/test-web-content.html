                            <p>As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node will sleep.</p>

                            <p>This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model where OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.</p>

                            <p>If some of this language is unfamiliar, there is a full article on <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/">Blocking vs Non-Blocking</a>.</p>

                            <hr />
                            <p>Node is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">Event Machine</a> or Python's <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>. Node takes the event model a bit further. It presents an <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/">event loop</a> as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script and at the end starts a server through a blocking call like <code>EventMachine::run()</code>. In Node there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.</p>

                            <p>HTTP is a first class citizen in Node, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.</p>

                            <p>Just because Node is designed without threads, doesn't mean you cannot take advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned by using our <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options"><code>child_process.fork()</code></a> API, and are designed to be easy to communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html"><code>cluster</code></a> module, which allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load balancing over your cores.</p>

                                had been active contributors, and who have significant
                                experience with the management of the project. Membership is
                                expected to evolve over time according to the needs of the project.</p>
                            <p>For the current list of TSC members, see the project

                            maintained by the TSC and additional Collaborators who are added by the
                            TSC on an ongoing basis.</p>
                            <p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
                                Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
                                individuals are identified by the TSC and their addition as
                                Collaborators is discussed during the weekly TSC meeting.</p>
                            <p><em>Note:</em> If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
                                for commit-access, log an issue or contact a TSC member directly and it
                                will be brought up in the next TSC meeting.</p>
                            <p>Modifications of the contents of the nodejs/node repository are made on
                                a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
                                modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
                                Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
                                Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
                                responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
                                by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
                                for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
                                participate and there is disagreement around a particular
                                modification. See <em>Consensus Seeking Process</em> below for further detail
                                on the consensus model used for governance.</p>
                            <p>Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
                                modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the
                                TSC for discussion by assigning the <strong><em>tsc-agenda</em></strong> tag to a pull
                                request or issue. The TSC should serve as the final arbiter where
                                required.</p>

                            However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
                            coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
                            make decisions efficiently.</p>
                            <p>There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TSC

                            <p>The TSC may add additional members to the TSC by a standard TSC motion.</p>
                            <p>A TSC member may be removed from the TSC by voluntary resignation, or by
                                a standard TSC motion.</p>
                            <p>Changes to TSC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be

                                employment by a TSC member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of
                                the TSC membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
                                immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more TSC
                                members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).</p>

                            <p>Items are added to the TSC agenda which are considered contentious or

                            <p>The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches.
                                That should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
                                group of Collaborators.</p>
                            <p>Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
                                the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
                                TSC member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
                                the <strong><em>tsc-agenda</em></strong> tag to the issue.</p>
                            <p>Prior to each TSC meeting, the moderator will share the Agenda with
                                members of the TSC. TSC members can add any items they like to the
                                agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the TSC
                                cannot veto or remove items.</p>
                            <p>The TSC may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to

                                will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
                                consensus.</p>
                            <p>If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a TSC member can call for
                                either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
                                meeting. The call for a vote must be approved by a majority of the TSC
                                or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.</p>
